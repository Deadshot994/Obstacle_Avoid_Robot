# IR Sensor Obstacle Avoider Robot

## Project Overview

The **IR Sensor Obstacle Avoider Robot** is a mini-project designed to navigate autonomously within an environment while avoiding obstacles using infrared (IR) sensors. It utilizes embedded systems and Arduino-based hardware to detect and respond to obstacles in real-time.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a robot capable of:

- Detecting obstacles in its path using IR sensors.
- Taking immediate and appropriate actions, such as:
  - Changing direction
  - Stopping movement
- Navigating independently without human intervention.

## Folder Structure
